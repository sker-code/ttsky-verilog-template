## How it works

This is a mini implementation of the nostalgic game Bomberman. It supports
two players, where each player has an up, down, left, right, and bomb button.

## How to test

Plug into the VGA monitor to see if the chip works. 

## External hardware

- VGA Pmod (https://store.tinytapeout.com/products/TinyVGA-Pmod-p678647356)
- Buttons (10x), wires, resistors, breadboard

## Implementation Details

Below is a more detailed view of how the implementation works:

### "tt_um_sker.v"
  
tt_um_sker module
- Wires the ports from the chip to the chip interface.
- In: "btn_up1"
- In: "btn_down1"
- In: "btn_left1"
- In: "btn_right1"
- In: "btn_up2"
- In: "btn_down2"
- In: "btn_left2"
- In: "btn_right2"
- In: "btn_bomb1"
- In: "btn_bomb2"

- Out: "red[0]"
- Out: "red[1]"
- Out: "green[0]"
- Out: "green[1]"
- Out: "blue[0]"
- Out: "blue[1]"
- Out: "VS"
- Out: "HS"

### "ChipInterface.sv"

ChipInterface module
- Connects Bomberman, VGA, and Display modules

### "Bomberman.sv"

Bomberman module
- Contains all the game logic
- Connects modules below together

Winner module
- Determines if a player has won based on if player 1 and 2 is alive

BombCounter module
- Counter for Bomb

Bomb module
- Determines bomb location and status based on player location and bomb button press


Player module
- Keeps track of the player location and alive status with buttons and other obstacles

ButtonBuffer module
- Buffer state for movement to be based on button press instead of hold

PrevPlayer module
- Keeps track of the previous location of a player

CurrMap module
- Logic for the current map display based on player locations, bomb locations, etc. 

ResetMap module 
- Value for default map on game start/reset

PrevMap module
- Stores the previous map in registers

Synchronizer module
- Synchronizer for buttons

### "VGA.sv"

VGA module
- Handles VGA display signals HS, VS, red, green, blue

### "Display.sv"

- Display encoding:
- 0: grass
- 1: breakable
- 2: unbreakable
- 3: fire
- 4: bomb
- 5: player1
- 6: player2

Display module
- Determines the rgb display values based on player location, current map, etc. 

MapDisplay module 
- Gives details of map display from player logic, splits rows and columns for map display

MapDisplayDecoder module
- Gives rbg values based on map value
